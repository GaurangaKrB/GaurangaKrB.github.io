I am a researcher in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My academic journey includes pursuing the Online BS Degree in Data Science and Applications from IIT Madras. I transitioned from the graduate program in Mathematics at IIT Kharagpur to complete my Masterâ€™s degree in Data Science at the prestigious Chennai Mathematical Institute (CMI), graduating in 2025.

In 2024, I was honored to receive the distinguished [Khorana Scholarship](https://iusstf.org/khorana-program-for-scholars) from the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India. Leveraging this scholarship, I had the incredible opportunity to conduct summer research at Harvard Medical School under the mentorship of [Prof. Yu-Hua Tseng](https://yhtsenglab.org/).

Outside my professional pursuits, I cherish diverse intellectual and recreational activities. I enjoy immersing myself in insightful literature, particularly biographies and autobiographies. cinematic arts (especially dramatic narratives), Chess, puzzle-solving, competitive programming, and engaging discussions on mathematics are among my favorite pastimes.

My creative interests extend to travel, photography, sketching, and writing philosophical and biographical articles. You can explore more of my thoughts and experiences in the [blogs](https://gaurangakrb.github.io/year-archive/) section.

I am always eager to connect, exchange ideas, and collaborate. Please feel free to reach out through any of my social media platforms.

### 

Welcome! I am currently working in the field of AI and ML. I have been a part of the (online) BS degree in Data Sciences and its Applications from IIT Madras. I dropped out of the graduate program in Mathematics from IIT Kharagpur to join the M.Sc. Data Science program at Chennai Mathematical Institute (CMI) from where I graduated in 2025. I received the prestigious [Khorana Scholarship](https://iusstf.org/khorana-program-for-scholars) from Dept. of Biotechnology, Govt. Of India in 2024 and I used this scholarship to spend my summer at Harvard Medical School to work with [Prof. Yu-Hua Tseng](https://yhtsenglab.org/).

During my free time I would love to read some amazing books, play a game of chess, teach math to a friend, solve puzzles, do some competitive coding, or watch a movie (preferably dramas). I love reading nonfiction (mostly biographies/autobiographies). I love traveling, doing photography and sketching or writing philosophical/biographical articles. If you are interested, go to my [blogs](https://gaurangakrb.github.io/year-archive/) section.

I am a researcher in AI and ML. My primary research areas include Causal AI, RL, and Gen AI. Additionally, I apply ML methodologies to interdisciplinary problems across Computational Biology, Public Health, Computational Linguistics (e.g., Psychology).

I transitioned from the graduate program in Mathematics at IIT Kharagpur to complete my Masterâ€™s degree in Data Science at the Chennai Mathematical Institute (CMI), graduating in 2025. In 2024, I was honored to receive the [Khorana Scholarship](https://iusstf.org/khorana-program-for-scholars) to spend my summer at Harvard Medical School under the mentorship of [Prof. Yu-Hua Tseng](https://yhtsenglab.org/).

Outside my professional pursuits, I cherish diverse intellectual and recreational activities: cinematic arts (especially dramatic narratives), Chess, puzzle-solving, competitive programming, travel, photography, sketching, and writing philosophical and biographical articles. You can explore more of my thoughts and experiences in the [blogs](https://gaurangakrb.github.io/year-archive/) section.

I am always eager to connect, exchange ideas, and collaborate. Please feel free to reach out through any of my social media platforms.

    “There is no safe investment. To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly be         broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not even to an animal. Wrap it carefully round       with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements; lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket      – safe, dark, motionless, airless – it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. The          alternative to tragedy, or at least to the risk of tragedy, is damnation. The only place outside Heaven where you can be perfectly safe         from all the dangers and perturbations of love is Hell.”

    “Like anybody can tell you, I am not a very nice man. I don't know the word. I have always admired the villain, the outlaw, the son of a        bitch. I don't like the clean-shaven boy with the necktie and the good job. I like desperate men, men with broken teeth and broken minds        and broken ways. They interest me. They are full of surprises and explosions. I also like vile women, drunk cursing bitches with loose          stockings and sloppy mascara faces. I'm more interested in perverts than saints. I can relax with bums because I am a bum. I don't like         laws, morals, religions, rules. I don't like to be shaped by society.”

    “Only once in your life, I truly believe, you find someone who can completely turn your world around. You tell them things that you’ve          never shared with another soul and they absorb everything you say and actually want to hear more. You share hopes for the future, dreams        that will never come true, goals that were never achieved and the many disappointments life has thrown at you. When something wonderful         happens, you can’t wait to tell them about it, knowing they will share in your excitement. They are not embarrassed to cry with you when        you are hurting or laugh with you when you make a fool of yourself. Never do they hurt your feelings or make you feel like you are not good     enough, but rather they build you up and show you the things about yourself that make you special and even beautiful. There is never any        pressure, jealousy or competition but only a quiet calmness when they are around. You can be yourself and not worry about what they will        think of you because they love you for who you are. The things that seem insignificant to most people such as a note, song or walk become       invaluable treasures kept safe in your heart to cherish forever. Memories of your childhood come back and are so clear and vivid it’s like      being young again. Colours seem brighter and more brilliant. Laughter seems part of daily life where before it was infrequent or didn’t         exist at all. A phone call or two during the day helps to get you through a long day’s work and always brings a smile to your face. In          their presence, there’s no need for continuous conversation, but you find you’re quite content in just having them nearby. Things that          never interested you before become fascinating because you know they are important to this person who is so special to you. You think of        this person on every occasion and in everything you do. Simple things bring them to mind like a pale blue sky, gentle wind or even a storm      cloud on the horizon. You open your heart knowing that there’s a chance it may be broken one day and in opening your heart, you experience      a love and joy that you never dreamed possible. You find that being vulnerable is the only way to allow your heart to feel true pleasure        that’s so real it scares you. You find strength in knowing you have a true friend and possibly a soul mate who will remain loyal to the         end. Life seems completely different, exciting and worthwhile. Your only hope and security is in knowing that they are a part of your life.”

  <blockquote style="margin: 0;">
    “Sometimes people walk away from love because it is so beautiful that it terrifies them. Sometimes they leave because the connection shines     a bright light on their dark places and they are not ready to work them through. Sometimes they run away because they are not                   developmentally prepared to merge with another- they have more individuation work to do first. Sometimes they take off because love is not      a priority in their lives- they have another path and purpose to walk first. Sometimes they end it because they prefer a relationship that      is more practical than conscious, one that does not threaten the ways that they organize reality. Because so many of us carry shame, we         have a tendency to personalize love's leavings, triggered by the rejection and feelings of abandonment. But this is not always true.            Sometimes it has nothing to do with us. Sometimes the one who leaves is just not ready to hold it safe. Sometimes they know something we        don't- they know their limits at that moment in time. Real love is no easy path- readiness is everything. May we grieve loss without            personalizing it. May we learn to love ourselves in the absence of the lover.”

Katalin Karikó

Just two days ago, I found myself stranded in Chennai due to the cyclone. Over the course of 8-10 uninterrupted hours, I seized the opportunity to immerse myself completely in 300 pages of her autobiography, reading it cover to cover without a single break!

It has been over four years since the global COVID-19 pandemic began in early 2020. Thanks to the remarkably effective vaccines developed and produced at unprecedented speed, those turbulent and uncertain days now seem like a distant memory. However, this extraordinary achievement would not have been possible without the lifetime contributions of Dr. Katalin Karikó. In her inspiring memoir, _Breaking Through: My Life in Science_, Dr. Karikó invites readers to explore her journey — from her childhood as a curious, hardworking nature enthusiast in a small Hungarian town to her bittersweet scientific career filled with both triumphs and setbacks, along with her experiences as a dedicated working mother in the field of science.

Katalin Karikó along with Drew Weissman won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2023 for “their discoveries concerning nucleoside base modifications that enabled the development of effective mRNA vaccines against COVID-19”

Picture this: You’re living in a war-torn country under a repressive communist regime marked by political instability and frequent shortages of essential goods and services. Your home is a simple adobe house without running water, let alone modern conveniences, situated in a small agricultural town of ten thousand people. Your parents never had the chance to pursue higher education or delve into science. In fact, your father, who never finished middle school, has been branded a political outcast by the oppressive government — denied employment because he sought to create a safer community in the face of man-made disasters. As a child, you take on various chores and odd jobs to help support your family financially. You battle persistent health challenges that grow increasingly complicated as you age, leading to regular hospital visits and surgeries becoming a routine part of your life. Yet, amid these adversities, your deep passion for learning and discovery never wavers. You work tirelessly, excel academically, and dream of studying biology at a prestigious university. However, an antagonistic teacher, driven by personal disdain, does everything possible to block your admission to one of the country’s top universities. Despite the odds, you confront this malicious obstacle head-on, unsure of the outcome. Thankfully, you prevail, opening the door to a new and thrilling chapter in your life.

These experiences shaped Katalin Karikó’s early life in Kisújszállás, Hungary, during the 1950s and 1970s. While they might seem overwhelming and almost unendurable to those in highly developed countries like the U.S., Karikó cherishes those times in Hungary. She fondly recalls exploring her surroundings, whether it was examining the viscera of pigs her father butchered, admiring the variety of flowers from her grandmother’s garden, or observing the plants like water lilies thriving in a local pond. To her, “biology is everywhere.” Her environment was rich with lessons that instilled in her a tenacity and drive to pursue academic and scientific goals — qualities that would guide her throughout her education and career.

Years later, as Dr. Karikó reflected on her journey while writing her memoir, she was overwhelmed with gratitude. She recalled the nature that inspired her curiosity, her incredibly supportive parents who always cheered her on, and her teachers who nurtured her academic abilities. She also remembered the many individuals she met throughout her life who shaped her path. For those intrigued by these stories, her memoir offers an intimate and enriching glimpse into a life fueled by perseverance and passion. Here’s a brief overview of what it contains.

Karikó pursued a degree in biology at the University of Szeged, where she demonstrated her trademark diligence and dedication. While some of her peers spent their time socializing or traveling to nearby countries, she immersed herself in her studies, spending countless hours mastering the material. Despite starting with limited exposure to subjects like English and chemistry labs, her determination to think critically and solve problems ensured her academic success. During this period, the phrase “Just one more thing” from the TV series _Columbo_ became a guiding principle — one more experiment, one more question, one more step forward.

1974: A portrait of Katalin Karikó, four years before completing her doctoral degree at the University of Szeged, a prestigious research university in Hungary.

By the time she completed her undergraduate studies, Karikó had already contributed to two research projects in Szarvas and another at the Biological Research Center (BRC) in Szeged as part of a fellowship. She remained at BRC to pursue her Ph.D., focusing on developing a novel RNA-based antiviral treatment. Incredibly, she played a hands-on role in establishing the lab infrastructure needed for her research, as the field of biological research lacked the extensive support industry available today. She built essential components from scratch, including a tissue culture room, sterile filtration systems, and culture media. This resourcefulness, meticulous attention to detail, and relentless drive were truly unmatched.

After earning her Ph.D., she continued working at the BRC until her funding was unexpectedly cut. Without complaint, Karikó made a bold and decisive choice. Turning to her husband Béla, she said, “I think we have to go to America.” This marked the beginning of a transformative chapter in her scientific journey.

This brings us to the story of the famous teddy bear. At the time, Hungarian citizens were prohibited from taking more than $50 out of the country. To circumvent this restriction, Karikó cleverly unstitched the back of her daughter’s toy bear and concealed extra cash inside it, ensuring they had additional funds for their journey to America. Upon arriving in the U.S., Karikó began working in the lab of biochemist Dr. Robert Suhadolnik. Over the course of three years, she made remarkable discoveries, eventually securing a new job. However, when Suhadolnik learned of her departure, his temperamental and abusive behavior reached its peak. He spread false rumors about her and even attempted to have her deported.

(right) Susan holds the teddy bear in which Karikó sewed their nest egg, proceeds from the sale of their car, due to Hungary’s strict cash export limits.

Despite these challenges, Karikó managed to find another position and, later, a more stable role at the University of Pennsylvania, allowing her to work closer to her family. Over her long career at Penn, she became a trailblazer in the field of mRNA delivery — a scientific breakthrough with the potential to transform medicine and public health. However, her work was often dismissed by colleagues and repeatedly rejected for funding. Yet, as she had always done, Karikó faced these obstacles with unwavering determination and perseverance, laying the groundwork for groundbreaking advancements that would later shape global health.

One day, Karikó found her usual copy machine occupied by none other than Dr. Drew Weissman, a brilliant immunologist. This chance encounter led to a partnership that would revolutionize vaccine development. Together, their complementary expertise made them a formidable team in pioneering mRNA vaccine research. Initial experiments showed promise but hit a major roadblock: the mRNA caused inflammation. With no existing research to explain why, they were left with only one option — conduct more experiments. Karikó’s mantra, “Just one more thing,” guided their persistence. After years of rigorous testing, they identified the culprit — unmodified bases in the mRNA. Their groundbreaking findings culminated in a seminal paper that became a cornerstone for developing the COVID-19 vaccine, marking a triumphant moment after years of relentless effort.

2001: Dr. Katalin Karikó, Dr. Drew Weissman, and their colleagues at Penn. Their collaboration, sparked by a chance meeting in 1997 at a photocopier, led to a 2005 breakthrough in mRNA delivery for immune activation.

Despite this monumental contribution, Karikó was forced into retirement in 2013. The reasons? A lack of publications in prestigious journals, limited funding, and relatively few citations — a harsh reality for many in the academic world.

Reflecting on her journey, Karikó expressed deep gratitude — not only to her close collaborators like Weissman but also to individuals like Suhadolnik and institutions like Penn. She recalled her childhood in Kisújszállás with a similar sense of appreciation. “I got everything I needed. And even more than that,” she said. Her determination and hard work turned long-overlooked breakthroughs into world-changing innovations.

This memoir offers a captivating look into Karikó’s life, blending personal resilience with scientific discovery. Her clear and engaging explanations make complex science accessible, ensuring readers from all backgrounds walk away both inspired and informed. It’s a story of perseverance, ingenuity, and gratitude — a must-read for anyone seeking to understand the human spirit behind one of modern science’s most significant achievements.

> “But even as a young child, I understood something critical: What I lacked in natural ability, I could make up for in effort. I could work harder, put in more hours, do more, and do it with greater care.”
